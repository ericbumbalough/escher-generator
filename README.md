# escher-generator
In 2014, the Renaissance and O'Keefe houses of the [ICC](icc.coop), merged into Escher house. To commemmorate this occasion, I wrote codes to generate a graphical mergeing of the the houses in the style of an [M. C. Escher transformation print](https://mcescher.com/gallery/transformation-prints/#) and lead a team that painted the mural on a wall at the physical location where the two houses connected. Recently, the [ICC shared the mural as part of an Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNuqJhBlKiU/).
